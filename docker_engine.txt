Docker Enginer has:
Docker CLI: it uses REST API to connect to Docker Deamon to perform actions
REST API: API interface that rprogram uses interact with docker daemon
DOCKER Deamon: background process Manages docker objexts such as images, volumes and networks 


We can use docker cli on a different machine to connect to docker on another machine like:
docker -H=remote-docker-engine:2375
docker -H=10.123.2.1:2375 run nginx

How does docker containerize these applications?
Docker uses namespace to isolate workspace, so a namespace are created like
mount, process ID, Network, interprocess and Unix Timesharing to provide isolation

Processes running inside a container are processes running on a underlining host.
So, two processes can not have same process ID, this is where namespace comes in. 

Each process can have multiple process Ids, when when a process id runs on docker container
then it will take the next process ID in the underlying Linux host PID.

In summary: Even though two processes are running on the same host, they are
seperated by namespace one in the Linux host and they other in container

How much of resources are dedicated? And how does docker manages them?
By default there is no restriction how much resource a container can use, so a container
can take all the underlying host. 

But, there is a way to restrict amount of CPU or memory a container can use.
Docker uses cgroup or control group, this can be used by providing:
docker run --cpu=.50 ubuntu # 50% of CPu ultilization
docker run --memory=100m ubuntu #limit the memory a container can use
