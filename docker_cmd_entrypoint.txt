Containers are not mean to run operating system, containers are meant to
fun a specific task or processes suck as host an instance of webserver or a databases server
once a task is complete then the container exits

docker run ubuntu [COMMAND]
docker run ubuntu sleep 5

How to make that change permanent?
You will have to make a image from base ubuntu image and give the specific command like:
FROM ubuntu

CMD sleep 5

#CMD commanbd param1 CMD sleep 5
#CMD ["command","param1"] --> CMD ["sleep","5"] #Correct way to give command and then use parameter
This is wrong way to specify command and param --> CMD ["sleep 5"]

now we can: docker build -t ubuntu-sleeper . #To build image
docker run ubuntu-sleeper
#Now container will run for 5 secs

docker run ubuntu-sleeper sleep 10
#This is will run the container for 10 secs but let's give a much cleaner look

This is use of Entrypoint instruction like:
FROM Ubuntu 

ENTRYPOINT["sleep"]

docker run ubuntu-sleeper 10
#This will also run the image for 10 secs 

 In case of CMD command line parameters get passed will replace entirely,
 where as in ENTRYPOINT will get appended on the command line
 FROM Ubuntu

 ENTRYPOINT ["sleep"]

 CMD["5"]

 docker run ubuntu-sleep 10
 #command at startup: sleep 10

 docker run --entrypoint sleep2.0 ubuntu-sleeper 10
