Docker Networking
When you install Docker, it creates 3 networks automatically
1) Bridge: Default network a container get attached to
docker run ubuntu
Bridge network is an private internal network that gets attached to the host
The container access each other using the internal ip
to access these external then we can map the ports

What if we want to isolate the containers?
we can create out own isolated network using:
docker network create \
    --driver bridge \
    --subnet 182.18.0.0/16
    custom-isolated-network

2)none:
docker run ubuntu --network=none
containers are not attached to any network, and they are isolated network
3) host:
docker run Ubuntu --network=host
associate the container to the host, this takes out isolation without any mapping ports


docker network ls 
#to list all network

docket inspect <contain-name> 
to check network settings and other settings

Embedded DNS:
mysql.connect ( <container-name )
Docker has a built in DNS to resolve 

what is the subnet configured with the bridge network?
docker network inspect bridge

Create a new network named wp-mysql-network using the bridge driver. Allocate subnet 182.18.0.0/24. Configure Gateway 182.18.0.1

Run the command: docker network create --driver bridge --subnet 182.18.0.0/24 --gateway 182.18.0.1 wp-mysql-network

Inspect the created network by docker network inspect wp-mysql-network
